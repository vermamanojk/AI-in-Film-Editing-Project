# AI-in-Film-Editing-Project
AI-Powered Automated Film Editor
This project is an automated video editing pipeline designed to handle the tedious parts of film production—like transcribing audio, syncing subtitles, and applying transitions—using Artificial Intelligence.

Overview
Built with Python, OpenAI Whisper, and MoviePy, this tool takes raw video clips and transforms them into a polished video with a thematic title, smooth cinematic transitions, and perfectly aligned subtitles.

Key Features

AI Transcription: Leverages the Whisper 'base' model to generate precise, timestamped text segments from your audio.

Contextual Titling: The system analyzes the transcript to programmatically suggest a creative title for the film.
Smooth Transitions: Implements "negative padding" logic to ensure CrossFades and Slides overlap correctly for a professional look.
Dynamic Subtitling: Subtitles are automatically wrapped and positioned to avoid being cut off at the screen edges.
Interactive UI: A dedicated Streamlit dashboard for easy file uploads and real-time rendering progress.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

AI Engine: OpenAI Whisper (Transformer-based ASR)

Video Processing: MoviePy (v2.0+)

Progress Tracking: Proglog

Installation & Usage
Clone the Repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-film-editing.git
cd ai-film-editing
Install Dependencies:

pip install streamlit openai-whisper moviepy proglog
Install ImageMagick: (Required by MoviePy for text rendering. Download from ImageMagick.org)

Run the Studio:

streamlit run ai_film_editor.py
AI Usage Disclosure
This project utilizes the OpenAI Whisper model for speech-to-text inference. Large Language Models (LLMs) were used during development to assist with debugging complex rendering issues and structuring technical documentation.

Developed as part of the Module E: AI Applications project track.
